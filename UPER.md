<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I understand that I will need to think from a test first perspective and use this method to 
determine when and where my objects need to be constructed. I'm creating a receipt with a sales tax of 10%
added to the accumulated total. I'm going to need to create classes for a book, cd, chocolate, imported chocolate and 
imported perfume. At first glance, I see the opportunity for an interface that will hold functions and properties
for my various classes. This will ensure that the code is dry. I also intend, after testing my way to this position, I
will also creat a class for the receipt that will accumulate the cost of each item. It will feature a method
that includes the math needed to add a 10% sales tax to the items. This will all be revealed through a test first basis, of course,
but this is the theoretical path that I intend to follow.

Please refer to attached images for a detailed chart of planning steps.

    3. Executing the Plan

I feel that my plan was well organized. I was able to stick to it and follow it all the way through, 
and it acted as a perfect guide. Admittedly, I was slow starting because it's such a different way of thinking,
however, after I wrote my first two test, it became clear which test should follow. I was sure to always build
a valid failing test to begin with, and follow it buy building a method, failing that method, and then passing it. 
I can see various ways that I could improve this code and utilize better OOP practices. I Literally followed my chart
the entire way through and it was accurate for the most part. I do feel that I miscalculated a couple aspects slightly. 
For instance, I didn't expect that most of my test would be oriented around my basket. The process was largely following the
unfolding path that was happening through the testing process. It was a really interesting way of coding.

    4. Reflection / Refactor

I see so much room for refactoring and I wish that I had more time to bring this to fruition. 
I think that I can tighten my test up and create code that follows "dry" principals. I really believe
a lot of this is first iteration code that isn't visually pleasing. I did refactor along the way and adjusted 
some of the code in my methods and a couple of test, however, there is room for much more if time permitted. I think
my basket page could be improved and I'm not happy with how I coded out the methods. I feel that I could clean up a lot of the 
code that is being generated to develop the taxes for various situations. Also, I would like to rework
my math calculations and optimize them. This was definitely a learning experience and took effort to 
get off the ground because It had a feeling of thinking backwards. Nonetheless, I see the value in it and would like to continue
to improve on it.
